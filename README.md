### MIYANO FAMILY- As an only child, Miyano appears to be close with his mother and bears a striking resemblance to her.

#### APPEARANCE 

`He is small and has feminine traits, such as wide eyes, short, wavy hair with long bangs, and a mole beneath his left eye. Despite his modest stature, his father's height of 188 cm gives him optimism (though his mother is only 152 cm tall).`

`Miyano usually wears his school uniform without a tie and a knit vest or sweater.`

#### PERSONALITY

`Miyano isn't very extroverted, but he's also not particularly bashful, and he has a number of close friends and solid ties with both current and prior students. While he is exceedingly indecisive about matters about which he is unsure, he is gung-ho once he has made up his mind. He is attentive and polite, never using honorifics with his superiors, but he is no pushover.`

`Miyano is quite sensitive about his feminine traits as a result of his previous experiences with classmates gently mocking him for looking 'girly' and the female he had a crush on recommending that he crossdress. While he has developed to appear slightly more manly than previously, he still battles to overcome this self-consciousness about his appearance.`

`While he does speak of situations as if they were prospective BL scenarios, he prefers to keep it to himself. Similarly, he is willing to talk about BL with Sasaki, but only when they are alone. Miyano is quite particular about what he is okay with depending on who else is involved and the situation.`

#### TRIVIA ABOUT MIYANO

   1. Miyano dislikes sweets because he finds them difficult to digest. Finding carbonated drinks feel wierd on his tongue, it is the same reason he does not like spicy food. Miyano even takes his coffee black. However, he is fond of wasabi flavored candies and has no problems with citrus flavored candies. 
   2. Though he enjoys reading manga, by his own admission he specializes in reading, not creating.
   3. He is bad at cooking.
   4. His shoe size is 25.5 cm.
   5. He claims he can handle alcohol well after accidentally consuming it once.
   6. He grew out his hair because he was told shorter hair exposing his forehead makes him look more feminine. He leaves it longer now, because shorter hair becomes frizzy.
   7. Miyano reviews his notes for school daily--a habit he's had since elementary school.
   8. Miyano starts borrowing CDs from Sasaki as the story progresses.
   9. In his second school year he becomes the vice president of the Disciplinary Committee; during a talk with Hanzawa during the Cultural Festival he declined becoming the president.
   10. He usually packs his lunch, though sometimes he buys it from the convenience store.
His power level is 34.
   11. Miyano's image animal is the rabbit.
